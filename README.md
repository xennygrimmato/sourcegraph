Remember the last time you were in flow while coding? You got a ton done and felt great.

But staying in flow is hard. While coding, you often waste minutes digging for examples in Q&A forums, finding documentation, deciphering code, or interrupting teammates.

[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) helps you find the answers you need in seconds, not minutes—so you stay in flow, get more done, and feel great.

##### Try Sourcegraph:

* [:mag_right: Instantly jump to any function/type/package in any repository — ***global, semantic code search***](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=http.NewRequest)
* [:earth_africa: See where/how a function/type/package is used, across all repositories — ***live usage examples & global cross-refs***](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/info/GoPackage/net/http/-/NewRequest)
* [:zap: Navigate and jump around code like an IDE](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/def/GoPackage/net/http/-/NewRequest)

...all in your web browser at sourcegraph.com. No installation or signup required. *It just works*, for both open-source code and your private projects (unless you do crazy stuff with your build tooling).

It's cross-repository and scalable, with 2,000,000,000+ nodes in the public code index (and growing).
